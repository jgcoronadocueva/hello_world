# Overview

This project focuses on building a simple application to practice core programming concepts. The program asks for the user's name and displays a personalized greeting.

The goal is to start writing code in C# and .NET while learning to handle user input, string manipulation, and basic console operations. This will serve as a foundation for more advanced projects in the future.
